# Alkemio Visualization Components
This package contains visualization components that are used within the Alkemio platform. 

The components are based on the d3 framework.

Components included:
* **Innovation Flow**: For visualizing the states and associated information for an Innovation Flow. Note that Innovation Flows are based on the [XState](https://xstate.js.org/) engine, so the input to an Innovation Flow visualization is actually an XState machine definition.
